# Fundamentals2

The site in this repository is one version made for my cousin who is a financial analyst.  The site is put together using bootstrap along with PHP.  While there are many files (ie css and js) some are not running as the components were not fully built out for this version.

There is an index.html and a blog.html which were used as prototypes for reaching out to potential customers and the blog used to provide a free tier for general information.

The html pages and main.css (heavily used) has been commented to help identify code.
